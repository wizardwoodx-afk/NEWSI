/**
 * Â§RUN CHECKPOINTS â€” a crash resumes instead of restarting.
 *
 * The enterprise bar for agent runtimes in one sentence: if step 14 of 20
 * fails at 3 a.m., the run resumes from step 13 â€” it does not start over.
 * The mission runtime already persists its task state (`checkpoints.ts`)
 * and can save/resume a whole runtime (`durable.ts`); THIS file is the
 * tamper-evident chain under the run-level story: every meaningful step of
 * a live run â€” a settled wave, a human gate opening, a decision landing â€”
 * appends to a chain any auditor can recompute.
 *
 * THE LAWS THIS FILE ENFORCES
 *  1. THE CHAIN IS THE EVIDENCE. Each checkpoint carries the digest of the
 *     state it saved AND the digest of the checkpoint before it. Recompute
 *     the chain and any edit â€” a lost step, a rewritten verdict â€” refuses.
 *  2. RESUME IS EARNED. `resumeRunFrom` returns the resume point only for
 *     a chain that verifies. A tampered journal refuses in words.
 *  3. A RESTART IS NOT A LOSS. The whole journal â€” chains AND the state
 *     snapshots they point at â€” is written to the host's storage through
 *     the project's ONE storage adapter (`durable.ts`: localStorage when
 *     the host really has it, an injected Map in Node, an ephemeral Map
 *     where neither exists). A crash wipes the module-level maps below;
 *     the journal on disk is what a restart reloads, so
 *     `loadRunJournal()` + `resumeRunFrom()` is a genuine resume rather
 *     than a fresh run wearing a resume's name.
 *  4. FAIL CLOSED. A journal that is corrupt, or whose `schemaVersion` is
 *     not one this build understands, is NEVER quietly dropped in favour
 *     of an empty chain. It refuses, in words, and the caller is told a
 *     journal existed. Starting fresh over a journal that was there is
 *     exactly the dishonesty this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * STATE OWNERSHIP (the 19.7.16 collision fix): a state snapshot is stored
 * under `runId` â†’ `stateDigest`, never under a bare digest. Two different
 * runs that happen to settle on byte-identical state used to share ONE
 * slot, so `resumeRunFrom` could hand a run the other run's snapshot.
 * The chain links on the digest; the SNAPSHOT lives in the run's own
 * table, and the two are checked against each other on resume.

/* ── RETRY LANES — a wait is not a failure ────────────────────────────────
 * §RETRY LANES (Paperclip, MIT — see `src/mission/retryLanes.ts` for the full
 * provenance and for why this is the seam the defect lives at).
 *
 * The chain already records every meaningful moment of a run: the repair ladder
 * takes a checkpoint, the human gate takes one, each settled wave takes one.
 * What it could not record was WHICH of those it was. So the only durable count
 * a resuming run had was one that read a three-hour wait at the gate exactly the
 * way it read three genuine failures — and the run's repair budget was the thing
 * measured against it.
 *
 * `recordLaneCheckpoint` fixes that WITHOUT touching the journal's schema:
 * the accounting is written into the checkpoint's own `state` payload, which the
 * chain already digests. That is deliberate twice over — no `schemaVersion` bump
 * means no run refuses to load a journal it wrote yesterday, and because the
 * state is digested, the accounting is tamper-evident for free: editing a run's
 * retry count breaks its chain link exactly like editing its label does. */

/** The run's durable, lane-separated retry accounting.
 *
 *  Two readings, in priority order, and both are conservative:
 *   - a saved block on the newest checkpoint is the authoritative one, because
 *     `recordLaneCheckpoint` advanced it from the previous one;
 *   - when there is none — a journal from before this module, or a host that
 *     only ever calls the plain `checkpoint()` — the chain's LABELS are folded
 *     instead, which is `historicalFailureRetries`'s deliberate posture: never
 *     reset a count nobody can prove, never inflate a wait into a failure.

 *  `Math.max` of the two, so a tampered or stale saved block can only ever be
 *  harder on the run than the labels, never softer. */
