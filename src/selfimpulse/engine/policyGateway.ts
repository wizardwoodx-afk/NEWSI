/**
 * §POLICY GATEWAY — the single decision seam for every proposed action.
 *
 * Before any tool call or dispatch reaches the execution plane, it MUST pass
 * through `policyGateway.propose(...)`. The gateway returns one of three
 * decisions:
 *
 *   • ALLOW   — the action may execute; an audit event is sealed into the
 *               receipt chain with the policy rule that allowed it.
 *   • STEER   — execution pauses for human approval; the UI surfaces the
 *               reason and waits for approve/deny.
 *   • DENY    — the action is refused in words, with the rule that refused
 *               it; no execution happens and the refusal is audited.
 *
 * The gateway is introduced in 17.1.3 to make the RISKY_TOOLS set a data-
 * driven policy rather than inline `if`s, and to prepare for CEL policy
 * rules (17.2). Every tool call — bridge, MCP, dispatch_mission — routes
 * through here, so future policies (budget, business-hours, workspace root,
 * egress scope, capability envelope) can be added in one place.
 *
 * The receipt chain always carries the decision: { kind: "policy", decision,
 * rule, reason, tool? } so refusals are auditable and the policy-replay
 * sandbox can re-evaluate historical chains against new rules.

 *   • an action OUTSIDE the envelope (high-risk on a read-only seat) STEERs
 *     to the human — the approval IS the owner act, and it is receipted;
 *   • a low-risk read within the envelope passes through (null), letting
 *     the named safe-class allow speak;
 *   • an UNCLASSIFIABLE action resolves to medium risk — which steers.
